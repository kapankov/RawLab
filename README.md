# RawLab

RawLab is a graphical user interface application that allows you to explore RAW files. The application is written in MS Visual Studio using the Qt framework, initially with support for Windows 7 (x64) and higher. In the future, three implementations are planned: a classic application for Windows, for MacOS and for Linux.

RawLab uses the Libraw library for working with RAW, as well as other libraries and the SDK for working with image files. OpenGL is used to display the image. The lcms library is used as a color management system.

RawLab is not an alternative to the common Raw-converter. The main goal is the ability to experiment with color and the conversion process at a low level.
